<p>This project is an implementation of an AI for a car racing game, developed using PyGame and NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies). The AI learns and optimizes its gameplay over time, allowing it to become better and more competitive in the game.</p>
<p>In this game, cars navigate a racing track, avoiding obstacles, and striving to reach the finish line as quickly as possible. The AI-controlled cars are trained using NEAT, a machine learning algorithm designed for evolving neural networks. Genetic algorithms are utilized to optimize the AI's performance.</p>
